## WHAT
A mildly entertaining website that you'll visit once, maybe twice, and then never return to it again, because why would you. It's a useless website after all, and you probably have some more important stuff to do than annoying a blue hand-animated troll. 

## WHY
I'm asking this myself every single day... But seriously, I just wanted to be on the other side of when-you're-trying-to-mind-your-own-buisness-but-there's-this-fly-that-you're-too-lazy-to-try-killing-so-you-just-keep-doing-what-you're-doing-but-annoyed situation for once. About as brainless as a fly simulator, so if, for some reason, you want to shortly drop you IQ to a single digit - I've got you fam. 

## HOW
Y'know. Drew some frames, loaded them in, failed to optimize. Cried a lot. Pulled myself together, created sprites and added animations, lowered the fps to the point where you're not really sure whether your PC is glitching or it's meant to be this way, added some timers and voila! 

## WHO
 Well, ME. The great and mighty Liarikai and my magical computer gremlins (who usually make sure your programs crash at the most inopportune moments)
